# latest-popular-post-unanswered
Auth0 Job Application. Hacking for fun and learn ;) Why are there forum posts with many times read or with many likes but nobody answers? Let's know which are those posts! This webtask uses a SDK API from the Auth0 forum to find the latest unanswered posts ordered by likes &amp; views. Then persists these posts in MongoDB and return them.
